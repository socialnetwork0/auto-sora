# Auto-Sora Hackathon Pitch Deck

**Project Title:** Auto-Sora: Fully Autonomous L4 AI Partner for Creators

**Brief Description:**
Auto-Sora is a fully autonomous L4 dialogue system generating cinema-quality Sora video prompts through AI-to-AI collaboration. Two specialized agents engage in 5-7 conversational rounds, debating and refining until producing professional prompts with technical precision. Sam Altman AI demonstrates our showcase persona‚Äîthe system adapts to any creator, company, or brand voice for customized strategies. Built with Claude Sonnet 4.5, it features intelligent dialogue flow, real-time streaming, and automatic extraction. Transform vague ideas into prompts with camera specs, lighting, and cinematic details in 3 minutes at $0.45. Scalable from solo creators to enterprise production teams, democratizing expert video prompt engineering.

**Gamma.app Instructions**: Copy each slide's content into Gamma's AI generator, select "Modern/Tech" theme, use auto-layout with images.

## SLIDE 1: WHY - The Problem

### Title
**Writing Effective Sora Prompts Requires Expertise**

### Main Content

**The Challenge:**

Getting quality results from Sora requires specific knowledge:

- **Film production**: Camera angles, lenses, lighting, shot composition
- **Technical vocabulary**: How to structure prompts for AI interpretation
- **Iterative refinement**: Understanding what works and why

**The Gap:**

Creators have ideas but lack the technical language to express them effectively.

**Current Solutions Fall Short:**
- Trial and error ‚Üí time-consuming
- Prompt templates ‚Üí limited creativity
- Prompt engineers ‚Üí expensive, not scalable

**What's Needed:**
A system that bridges creative vision and technical execution automatically.

### Visual Suggestions for Gamma:
- Simple side-by-side: basic prompt vs detailed professional prompt
- Three challenge icons (film knowledge, technical vocabulary, iteration)
- Clean, minimal design

## SLIDE 2: WHAT - Our Solution

### Title
**Auto-Sora: L4 Autonomous Dialogue System**

### Main Content

**How It Works:**

```
üë§ Creative Agent        ü§ñ Expert Agent
   (Any persona)         (Prompt specialist)
        ‚Üì                        ‚Üì
     Proposes              Refines with
      vision              technical detail
        ‚Üì                        ‚Üì
    5-7 rounds of autonomous conversation
        ‚Üì
    Production-ready prompt
```

**System Design:**

1. **L4 Autonomous Dialogue**
   - Two agents debate and iterate without human intervention
   - Creative agent: Strategic vision (we demo with Sam Altman persona)
   - Expert agent: Technical refinement using 200+ proven patterns

2. **Customizable Personas**
   - Sam Altman AI is our showcase example
   - System adapts to any creator, brand, or company voice
   - Persona-driven for consistent creative strategy

3. **Dual Interface**
   - Web UI: Real-time streaming visualization
   - CLI: Batch generation for production workflows

**Example Output:**

> *"A contemplative medium shot of a street artist in Brooklyn during golden hour, spray-painting a vibrant mural of interconnected hands reaching skyward. Warm amber light filters through urban architecture, casting long shadows. Shot on Arri Alexa with 50mm lens, shallow depth of field isolating the artist against soft bokeh background. Slow tracking shot following the fluid motion of creation, capturing authentic urban storytelling with cinematic color grading."*

### Visual Suggestions for Gamma:
- Clean dialogue flow diagram with arrows
- Screenshot of Web UI showing agent conversation
- Example prompt in quote card format
- Emphasis on "Any Persona" with multiple avatar silhouettes

## VISUAL ASSETS CHECKLIST

Prepare these for optimal Gamma results:

1. **Web UI screenshot**: Show the agent dialogue interface
2. **Architecture diagram**: Simple flowchart showing system components
3. **Example prompt comparison**: Before (simple) vs After (detailed)
4. **Persona flexibility visual**: Show multiple personas (not just Sam)

Keep visuals clean and minimal‚Äîlet the content speak for itself.

---

## JUDGE Q&A PREPARATION

**Q: Why two AIs instead of one?**
A: Dialogue creates iterative refinement. One AI generates, the other critiques and improves. Our testing shows more detailed and technically accurate prompts compared to single-shot generation.

**Q: Why Sam Altman as the persona?**
A: He's our showcase example. The system is persona-agnostic‚Äîusers can define any creative voice: Spielberg, their brand, their CEO, etc.

**Q: What if Sora API isn't available?**
A: System works with any text-to-video model. We've tested with Runway and Pika. Sora is the target but not a dependency.

**Q: How do you ensure prompt quality?**
A: Expert agent is grounded in 200+ high-performing prompts. Creative agent uses controlled temperature (0.8) to balance creativity with coherence.

**Q: Business model?**
A: Freemium model similar to other AI tools. Free tier for testing, paid tiers for production use. Focus is on demonstrating technical capability first.

**Q: Open source?**
A: Considering options. Current focus is proving the concept and gathering feedback.

## PRESENTATION TIPS

**Do:**
- Speak calmly and clearly
- Let the system speak for itself
- Emphasize technical innovation (L4, role flipping)
- Show real output examples
- Be open about limitations

**Don't:**
- Overhype or exaggerate
- Make unsupported claims
- Rush through technical details
- Ignore questions or deflect
